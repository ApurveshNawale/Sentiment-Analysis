## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in textual data. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for text analysis and sentiment classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

The project covers various aspects, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, text vectorization, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, model interpretation, and performance evaluation using various metrics and visualizations.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing textual data and corresponding sentiment labels. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size or potential licensing restrictions. Please refer to the documentation for instructions on obtaining and preparing the dataset.
The dataset used in this project is sourced from The dataset used in this project is sourced from  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset/data)
